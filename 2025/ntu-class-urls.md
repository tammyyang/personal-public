As AI-generated content becomes more sophisticated and widespread, distinguishing authentic content from manipulated or fabricated material becomes increasingly difficult, threatening public trust in media, democratic processes, and digital information.

## Solution

Several technologies and initiatives have emerged to address these challenges:
- [NIST AI 100-4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.100-4.pdf) - NIST Trustworthy and Responsible AI
  
### C2PA

- [C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity)](https://c2pa.org/) - Technical standards for certifying content authenticity
- [Content Credentials Verification Tool](https://contentcredentials.org/verify) - Platform for verifying digital content
- [C2PA's Worst Case Scenario](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1013-C2PAs-Worst-Case-Scenario.html) - Discussions for the C2PA weakness

### Numbers Protocol
- [Numbers Protocol](https://www.numbersprotocol.io/) - Blockchain-based solution for content verification
- [Example of C2PA verified content](https://contentcredentials.org/verify?source=https://ipfs-pin.numbersprotocol.io/ipfs/bafkreih77dwpvs3aq2fejegbje4tnxkirwqgj4yrssnw2butmyj7b6zvoq) - Demonstration of content verification
